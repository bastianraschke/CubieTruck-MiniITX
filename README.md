# CubieTruck-MiniITX

I developed a mask to fasten a CubieTruck on the Mini-ITX mounting used in many small PC casings.


## How-to

I documented the process of building the mounting and I/O shield:

* [Part 1: Building the Mini-ITX Mask](Story/Story_Pt1_Mini-ITX_Mask.md)
* [Part 2: Building the CubieTruck Input/Output Shield](Story/Story_Pt2_IO_Shield.md)


## Development

I measured my own CubieTruck and a regular PC casing.
Based on that I drew the schematics using [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/).
The measurements have been validated by trial and error and might be slightly inaccurate.
Please refer to the layers in the SVG source file for more details.

Feel free to contribute by adding further layers, etc.
